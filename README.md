# make-a-beat

### What is this?

A simple but cool web application that lets you create a beat of your own just using your keyboard. Explore your inner creativity using the application and enjoy!!

### How does this work?

The sublime animation is created using paper.js. Each key has a designated color and each time the user presses a key, a new circle is generated with that color at a random position in the screen. This gives a great visual.

The sounds are added and played using howler.js every time a key is pressed.
